# To-Do List Application

A simple command-line to-do list application in Python. This application allows users to add, view, delete, and mark tasks as completed. Tasks are saved to a file, so they persist even after restarting the program.

## Features

- **View Tasks**: Displays all tasks, showing which are completed or pending.
- **Add Task**: Adds a new task to the list.
- **Delete Task**: Removes a specific task from the list.
- **Mark Task as Completed**: Marks a specific task as done.
- **Persistent Storage**: Saves tasks to a `tasks.txt` file, so they remain available even after closing the program.

## How It Works

Tasks are stored in a file named `tasks.txt`. Each task has a status (`pending` or `completed`), allowing you to keep track of which tasks are finished.
